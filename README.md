# MultiTargetPFI_BG_Analysis
Analysis scripts for Multitarget PFI background SSVEP project

Scripts are numbered/ordered as they can be performed.
Within each script a job.struct is created.
Change the subfield to .struct =1 for the appropriate jobs, and the corresponding analysis/plots will be performed.

Please note that these scripts are ordered, but not fastidiously commented. Any questions please contact Matt Davidson, mjd070@gmail.com
